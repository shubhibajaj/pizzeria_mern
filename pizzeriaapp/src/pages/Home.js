            with wacky and fun excuses. The person with the best excuse won the Best Excuse Badge and won Pizzeria's vouchers. Their enthusiastic response proved
            that Pizzeria's Fresh Pan Pizza is the Tastiest Pan Pizza. Ever!</p>
            
            <p className="a">Ever since we launched the Tastiest Pan Pizza, ever, people have not been able to resist the softest, cheesiest, crunchiest, butteriest Domino's Fresh Pan
            Pizza. They have been leaving the stage in the middle of a performance and even finding excuses to be disqualified in a football match.</p>

                <p>We're ruthless about goodness. We have no qualms about tearing up a day-old
                lettuce leaf (straight from the farm), or steaming a baby (carrot). Cut. Cut. Chop.
                Chop. Steam. Steam. Stir Stir. While they're still young and fresh - that's our motto. It
                makes the kitchen a better place.</p>

                <p>They make sauces sing and salads dance. They create magic with skill,
                knowledge, passion, and stirring spoons (among other things). They
                make goodness so good, it doesn't know what to do with itself. We do
                though. We send it to you.</p>
